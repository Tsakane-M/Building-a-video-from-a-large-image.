To run:
 1) Go into directory from terminal and run "make clean" FIRST to make sure directory is clean of all object files and Frame_Dir
 2) Run "make" command in terminal to compile the program 
 3) Run "make run" to launch program with default arguments: ./extractor.exe ../sloan_image.pgm -t 100 300 300 600 -s 640 480 1968 -w none Sequence
 else to run with different arguments, run the program from terminal with arguments:
 
        The command line options for your program is extractor <inputPGMfile> [options],
        where <inputPGMfile> is the large image you read in and [options] is a list of the
        following parameters:
        -t <int> <int> <int> <int> # x1 y1 x2 y2 (begin & end origin pixel coords,
        for frame trajectory)
        -s <int> <int> # <width> <height> (size of small frame in
        pixels)
        -w <string> <string> # write frames with <operation> <name>

        For the -w flag, the parameter <operation> = none | invert | reverse | revinvert,
        where none: no modification of data, invert: each pixel value v become 255-v, reverse:
        reverse output (write frames out from last to first), revinvert: reverse and invert out
        put. The parameter <name> = name of sequence base e.g. sequence-0000.pgm, sequence0001.pgm 
        etc will be generated with <name> set to ‘sequence’.
        

extractor.cpp : The driver file that houses the user interface. This contains the event loops and user interaction handling.

extractor_functions.cpp : This is the main implementation file that contains all the methods used to process the image and extract 
frames and save them when program is running. 
This is accessed from the driver file to provide results to the driver.

extractor.h : This is the header file to the .cpp implementation. It has all the declarations for the .cpp files to preprocess.
